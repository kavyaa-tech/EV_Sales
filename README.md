# EV Sales Analysis and Insights

This project focuses on analyzing the electric vehicle (EV) sales data across different states and years. Using SQL queries, the dataset was explored to uncover trends, regional insights, and vehicle class breakdowns. The goal is to understand the overall market trends in EV sales, as well as how different states and vehicle categories contribute to the total sales.

## Technologies Used:
- SQL (SQL Server)
- Git/GitHub (for version control)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Import the `EV_Dataset.sql` into your preferred SQL environment (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
3. Run the SQL queries in the order provided to replicate the analysis results.
4. (Optional) If using a visualization tool, connect the database to the tool for further analysis.

## Features

1. What is the yearly trend in EV sales? Is there an overall increase or decrease over time?
2. Which months typically see the highest and lowest EV sales across years?
3. Which states have the highest and lowest EV sales?
4. Which state having the highest average number of sales per year?
5. What are the top-selling vehicle classes and categories?
6. What percentage of total EV sales does each vehicle category contribute?
7. Which state showed the largest increase or decrease in sales compared to the previous year?
8. Which states are leaders in specific vehicle classes, such as buses or agricultural tractors?


## Conclusions and Future Work
- The EV market has shown significant growth, particularly in states like Uttar Pradesh.
- Future analysis could focus on the impact of policy changes on sales or the relationship between infrastructure development and EV sales.
